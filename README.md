# slot-machine-using-python
A simple slot machine using python

I know this may not be the best slot machine , but from a beginner pov who  is just curious about making projects using python and is just bored learning all the theoritical concepts and want to make something based on existing learning , this will be a great start.

This project give you a better understanding of functions,loops,contitionals,string operations etc... 

what is this project all about?
1. The user deposit amount into the slot machine
2. The number of lines he/she wants to bet (horizontal reels), if all the characters matches in that particular reel, the user will be rewared with prize money.  
3. set a bet amount. This will be multipilied with number of lines the user bets.
4. a function get_slot_machine_spin() will spin the slot machine , using python random module, random character will be generated
5. displays the characters of the slot machine , in a matrix manner
6. checks if the character in entire row gets matched. if matched the character value will be multiplied with the bet amount of each line
7. repeatedly ask the user if he want to play or not. if want to quit will return with left amount.
